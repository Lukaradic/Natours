This project helped me to understand SASS, responsive design, animations and most of all to get comfortable with CSS in general.
I have learned many new ways to style my page to make it attractive, functional and responsive so that it pleases the majority of users on all devices.
The idea and design of this project are took from the udemy course that i have put a link to on my portfolio page.
